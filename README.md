# Final-Results

This repository highlights some of the final results of many projects that I'm very proud of. <br>

# Reservoir Computing & Chaos
* This paper associated with the research I performed at BYU will hopefully be available mid-2022. More details to come. 

# RISK Game Prediction
* Predicting the winner of the board game Risk was potentially one of my favorite parts of my undergraduate. I was able to apply valuable ML techniques to an interesting problem, as well as lead the large scale data generation, engineering and analysis.

# Prediction Movie Revenue
* What movies make money? What determines success? I applied machine learning to a novel dataset to find out. Here's the back story. I took a graduate level machine learning class. As the final project we were able to submit proposals, and 2 other people decided to work with me on my proposal of predicting movie revenue. Although we had limited resources, especially time, we had a lot of fun doing this.

# General Conference NLP
* What is the culmination of your work? This paper is the result of the final semester of my undergraduate in Applied Math. I applied various Time Series methodologies to identify themes in public discourses.

# Non-Trivial Pursuit
* The dynamics of a fox pursuing an evading rabbit can be very complex. Several animations of the different scenarios have been uploaded to my youtube channel.

# Non-Trivial Evasion
* Everybody loves a sequel. The dynamics of evasion are explored from an optimal control perspective to complement the previous exploration of Non-Trivial Pursuit.

# Literature Review
* This is my final project for my technical writing class. I was able to choose the topic and I loved learning about cognitive processes associated with computational / algorithmic thinking and how children can exercise these processes when giving the right tools & instruction, even at a young age.
